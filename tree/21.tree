ðŸ’¡ Question-1

You are given a binary tree. The binary tree is represented using the TreeNode class. Each TreeNode has an integer value and left and right children, represented using the TreeNode class itself. Convert this binary tree into a binary search tree.

Input:

        10

       /   \

     2      7

   /   \

 8      4

Output:

        8

      /   \

    4     10

  /   \

2      7

**Input-1:**

n = 9

values = [8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14,13]

node-1 = 6

node-2 = 14

**Output-1:**

The distance between the two keys = 4

**Input-2:**

n = 9

values = [8, 3, 1, 6, 4, 7, 10, 14,13]

node-1 = 3

node-2 = 4

**Output-2:**

The distance between the two keys = 2
