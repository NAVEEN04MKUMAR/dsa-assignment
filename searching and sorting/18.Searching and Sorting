💡 1. **Merge Intervals**

Given an array of `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [starti, endi]`, merge all overlapping intervals, and return *an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlap, merge them into [1,6].

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= intervals.length <= 10000`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi <= 10000`

💡 2. **Sort Colors**

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **[in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm)** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white, and blue.

We will use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue, respectively.

You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,0,1]
Output: [0,1,2]

```

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

💡 3. **First Bad Version Solution**

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, bad = 1
Output: 1

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= bad <= n <= 2^31 - 1`
</aside>

<aside>
💡 4. **Maximum Gap**

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the maximum difference between two successive elements in its sorted form*. If the array contains less than two elements, return `0`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in linear time and uses linear extra space.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,6,9,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [10]
Output: 0
Explanation: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
</aside>

<aside>
💡 5. **Contains Duplicate**

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if any value appears **at least twice** in the array, and return `false` if every element is distinct.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: true

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,3,3,4,3,2,4,2]
Output: true

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `109 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
</aside>

💡 6. **Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons**

There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane. The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array `points` where `points[i] = [xstart, xend]` denotes a balloon whose **horizontal diameter** stretches between `xstart` and `xend`. You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.

Arrows can be shot up **directly vertically** (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with `xstart` and `xend` is **burst** by an arrow shot at `x` if `xstart <= x <= xend`. There is **no limit** to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely, bursting any balloons in its path.

Given the array `points`, return *the **minimum** number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons*.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
- Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
- Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].

```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= points.length <= 10^5`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `231 <= xstart < xend <= 2^31 - 1`

💡 7. **Longest Increasing Subsequence**

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of the longest **strictly increasing***

***subsequence***

.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1

```

Return `true` *if there is a **132 pattern** in* `nums`*, otherwise, return* `false`*.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no 132 pattern in the sequence.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [3,1,4,2]
Output: true
Explanation: There is a 132 pattern in the sequence: [1, 4, 2].

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [-1,3,2,0]
Output: true
Explanation: There are three 132 patterns in the sequence: [-1, 3, 2], [-1, 3, 0] and [-1, 2, 0].

💡 3. **Sort an Array**

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in ascending order and return it.

You must solve the problem **without using any built-in** functions in `O(nlog(n))` time complexity and with the smallest space complexity possible.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,2,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: After sorting the array, the positions of some numbers are not changed (for example, 2 and 3), while the positions of other numbers are changed (for example, 1 and 5).

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [5,1,1,2,0,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,5]

💡 4. **Move all zeroes to end of array**

Given an array of random numbers, Push all the zero’s of a given array to the end of the array. For example, if the given arrays is {1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0}, it should be changed to {1, 9, 8, 4, 2, 7, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0}. The order of all other elements should be same. Expected time complexity is O(n) and extra space is O(1).

**Example:**

```
Input :  arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0};
Output : arr[] = {1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0};

Input : arr[]  = {1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6};

💡 5. **Rearrange array in alternating positive & negative items with O(1) extra space**

Given an **array of positive** and **negative numbers**, arrange them in an **alternate** fashion such that every positive number is followed by a negative and vice-versa maintaining the **order of appearance**. The number of positive and negative numbers need not be equal. If there are more positive numbers they appear at the end of the array. If there are more negative numbers, they too appear at the end of the array.

**Examples:**

> Input:  arr[] = {1, 2, 3, -4, -1, 4}
Output: arr[] = {-4, 1, -1, 2, 3, 4}

Input:  arr[] = {-5, -2, 5, 2, 4, 7, 1, 8, 0, -8}

💡 **Question 1**

Given a non-negative integer `x`, return *the square root of* `x` *rounded down to the nearest integer*. The returned integer should be **non-negative** as well.

You **must not use** any built-in exponent function or operator.

- For example, do not use `pow(x, 0.5)` in c++ or `x ** 0.5` in python.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.

```

**Example 2:**

💡 **Question 2**

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.

💡 **Question 3**

****

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return *the only number in the range that is missing from the array.*

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

💡 **Question 6**

Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is **rotated** between `1` and `n` times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:

- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times.

Notice that **rotating** an array `[a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]]` 1 time results in the array `[a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]]`.

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` of **unique** elements, return *the minimum element of this array*.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n) time.`

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The original array was [1,2,3,4,5] rotated 3 times.

```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: The original array was [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] and it was rotated 4 times.

```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: nums = [11,13,15,17]
Output: 11
Explanation: The original array was [11,13,15,17] and it was rotated 4 times.

If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

```

**Example 2:**
